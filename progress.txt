# Ralph Progress Log - Code-Behind Migration

Branch: ralph/code-behind-migration
Started: 2026-02-06

## Codebase Patterns
- Existing code-behind pattern: file-scoped namespace, `public partial class`, `[Inject] private` properties with `= default!`
- Pages use namespace `NowThenNext.Pages`, Components use `NowThenNext.Components`
- No `ComponentBase` inheritance needed in code-behind (Blazor infers it from the .razor file)
- `@page` directive, `<PageTitle>`, `<style>` blocks stay in the .razor file
- Check `_Imports.razor` before adding usings to code-behind — many are already global
- Run E2E tests after every story: `dotnet test tests/NowThenNext.Tests.E2E`
- WASM build is broken in local environment (ComputeWasmBuildAssets MSB4216 error) - pre-existing issue, not caused by code changes
- Use `dotnet build` to verify C# compilation (check for 0 C# errors even if WASM toolchain fails)
- Heredoc commit messages fail due to sandbox tmp restrictions - use inline `-m` flag instead
