# Ralph Progress Log - Learning Cards

Branch: ralph/learning-cards
Started: 2026-02-07

## Codebase Patterns
- Existing code-behind pattern: file-scoped namespace, `public partial class`, `[Inject] private` properties with `= default!`
- Pages use namespace `NowThenNext.Pages`, Components use `NowThenNext.Components`
- Check `_Imports.razor` before adding usings to code-behind — many are already global
- Run E2E tests after every story: `dotnet test tests/NowThenNext.Tests.E2E`
- WASM build is broken in local environment (ComputeWasmBuildAssets MSB4216 error) - pre-existing issue, not caused by code changes
- Use `dotnet build` to verify C# compilation (check for 0 C# errors even if WASM toolchain fails)
- Heredoc commit messages fail due to sandbox tmp restrictions - use inline `-m` flag instead
- Tailwind config is inline in wwwroot/index.html
- Follow PhonicsDataService pattern for static built-in data
- Dev server runs on localhost:5161

## 2026-02-07 - US-049
- Created LearningCategory and LearningCard models in Models/LearningCardModels.cs
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Models/LearningCardModels.cs (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Models follow same pattern as ImageItem: file-scoped namespace, auto-initialized properties with defaults
  - PhonicsModels.cs puts multiple related models in one file, so LearningCardModels.cs follows the same convention (both LearningCategory and LearningCard in one file)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-050
- Added calm-cards colour tokens to Tailwind config in wwwroot/index.html
- Colours: calm-cards (#D4937A), calm-cards-dark (#B87A62), calm-cards-light (#E0B0A0)
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/wwwroot/index.html (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind colour tokens are nested under the 'calm' object, so they're used as `bg-calm-cards`, `text-calm-cards`, etc.
  - Follow the pattern of existing colour groups (phonics, activity) - add comment, then three entries (base, dark, light)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-051
- Created LearningCardsBuiltInData static class in Services/LearningCardsBuiltInData.cs
- Shapes category: id='shapes', name='Shapes', emoji='🔷', isBuiltIn=true
- 8 shape cards: circle, square, triangle, rectangle, star, heart, diamond, oval
- Each card has hand-crafted inline SVG with varied calm colours (teal, green, coral, blue, amber, phonics-light, cards-dark)
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Services/LearningCardsBuiltInData.cs (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Static class pattern works well for built-in data - no DI needed, just static methods
  - SVG strings use raw string literals (triple quotes) for readability
  - Card IDs follow pattern: `{categoryId}-{shapeName}` (e.g. `shapes-circle`)
  - Used varied colours from the calm palette for visual interest: #5B9A9A (teal), #7BA893 (green), #D4937A (coral), #7BA3C4 (blue), #D4A06A (amber), #E0B0A0 (cards-light), #9BBDD6 (phonics-light), #B87A62 (cards-dark)
  - CreatedAt set to a fixed date (2026-01-01) so built-in categories always sort before custom ones
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-052
- Added Colours category and 10 colour cards to LearningCardsBuiltInData
- Colours category: id='colours', name='Colours', emoji='🎨', isBuiltIn=true
- 10 colour cards: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, brown, black, white
- Each card uses a rounded rectangle SVG swatch (rx="12") filled with the actual teaching colour
- White card includes a light grey stroke so it's visible against white backgrounds
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Services/LearningCardsBuiltInData.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Colour cards use real representative colours, not the calm palette (per PRD requirement)
  - Colour hex values used: #E74C3C (red), #3498DB (blue), #2ECC71 (green), #F1C40F (yellow), #E67E22 (orange), #9B59B6 (purple), #E91E9C (pink), #8B4513 (brown), #2C3E50 (black), #FFFFFF (white)
  - White/light colours need a stroke outline to remain visible - used stroke="#CCCCCC" stroke-width="2"
  - Card ID pattern continues: `{categoryId}-{colourName}` (e.g. `colours-red`)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-053
- Added Animals category and 12 animal cards to LearningCardsBuiltInData
- Animals category: id='animals', name='Animals', emoji='🐾', isBuiltIn=true
- 12 animal cards: cat, dog, fish, bird, horse, cow, pig, sheep, rabbit, elephant, lion, tiger
- Each card has a simple, friendly SVG illustration with key distinguishing features
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Services/LearningCardsBuiltInData.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Animal SVGs use basic shapes (ellipses, circles, paths, lines) to create recognisable silhouettes
  - Key distinguishing features for each animal: cat (pointed ears, tail), dog (floppy ears, wagging tail), fish (tail fin, scales), bird (beak, wings, legs), horse (mane, long legs, tail), cow (black patches, horns, pink nose), pig (snout with nostrils, curly tail, big ears), sheep (fluffy circles body, dark face/legs), rabbit (long ears, whiskers, cotton tail), elephant (trunk, big ear, thick legs), lion (mane as outer circle, body), tiger (stripes on head/body, rounded ears)
  - White/light-coloured animals (cow, sheep) need a stroke outline to remain visible against white backgrounds
  - Warm colour palette used: #E8A87C (cat), #C4956A/#A67B5B (dog), #5B9A9A (fish), #7BA3C4 (bird), #A67B5B (horse), white/#2C3E50 (cow), #F0B4B4 (pig), #F5F0E8/#2C3E50 (sheep), #E8DDD0 (rabbit), #9BBDD6 (elephant), #E8C88A/#D4A06A (lion), #E8A84C (tiger)
  - Card ID pattern continues: `{categoryId}-{animalName}` (e.g. `animals-cat`)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-054
- Added Dinosaurs category and 8 dinosaur cards to LearningCardsBuiltInData
- Dinosaurs category: id='dinosaurs', name='Dinosaurs', emoji='🦕', isBuiltIn=true
- 8 dinosaur cards: T-Rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Ankylosaurus, Diplodocus
- Each card has a simple, friendly SVG illustration with key distinguishing features
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Services/LearningCardsBuiltInData.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dinosaur SVGs use the same basic shapes approach (ellipses, circles, paths, lines) as animal SVGs
  - Key distinguishing features for each dinosaur: T-Rex (big head, tiny arms, sharp teeth), Triceratops (frill, horns, beak), Stegosaurus (back plates, tail spikes), Brachiosaurus (very long neck, small head), Velociraptor (sleek body, clawed feet, tail), Pteranodon (large wings, head crest, beak), Ankylosaurus (armoured bumps, club tail), Diplodocus (long neck, long whip tail, small head)
  - Used varied colours from the calm palette: #7BA893 (T-Rex green), #D4A06A (Triceratops amber), #5B9A9A (Stegosaurus teal), #9BBDD6 (Brachiosaurus blue), #E8C88A (Velociraptor sandy), #D4937A (Pteranodon coral), #7BA3C4 (Ankylosaurus phonics blue), #D4A06A (Diplodocus amber)
  - Dinosaur emoji 🦕 Unicode is U+1F995, UTF-16 surrogate pair: \ud83e\udd95
  - Card ID pattern continues: `{categoryId}-{dinoName}` (e.g. `dinosaurs-trex`)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-055
- Created ILearningCardsDataService interface and LearningCardsDataService implementation
- Interface defines: GetAllCategoriesAsync, GetCardsByCategoryAsync, AddCustomCategoryAsync, AddCustomCardAsync, DeleteCustomCardAsync, DeleteCustomCategoryAsync
- Service combines built-in data (from LearningCardsBuiltInData static class) with custom data persisted in localStorage under key 'learning-cards'
- Built-in categories returned in fixed order (Shapes, Colours, Animals, Dinosaurs), custom categories ordered by CreatedAt
- Delete/add methods guard against modifying built-in items
- Registered as scoped service in Program.cs DI container
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Services/ILearningCardsDataService.cs (new), src/NowThenNext/Services/LearningCardsDataService.cs (new), src/NowThenNext/Program.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Followed PhonicsProgressService pattern for localStorage access (IJSRuntime, try/catch, StorageQuotaExceededException)
  - Used a private nested CustomLearningData class to structure the localStorage JSON (Categories list + Cards list)
  - Built-in category lookup uses a switch expression for clean pattern matching
  - GetCardsByCategoryAsync returns built-in cards directly when category is built-in, only queries localStorage for custom categories
  - Service is scoped (not singleton) because it depends on IJSRuntime which requires per-circuit scoping in Blazor WASM
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-056
- Added Learning Cards menu group to home page after Phonics section
- New menu group uses calm-cards theme colour (#D4937A) with flashcard SVG icon
- Links to /learning route
- Updated HomePageTests to expect 5 menu groups (was 4) and verify the 5th group has 1 button
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Pages/Home.razor (modified), tests/NowThenNext.Tests.E2E/Tests/HomePageTests.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adding a new menu group requires updating the HomePage_MenuButtonsAreGroupedInPairs test which asserts the exact count of .menu-group elements
  - The flashcard icon (rectangle with cross lines) visually represents learning cards well at the menu icon size
  - E2E tests pass: 74/74 (up from 69 baseline mentioned in CLAUDE.md - test count grew during prior stories)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-057
- Created LearningCategories.razor page at route /learning with code-behind LearningCategories.razor.cs
- Page displays all categories as large tiles in a responsive grid (2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- Each tile shows category emoji and name, links to /learning/{categoryId}
- Built-in categories show in fixed order (Shapes, Colours, Animals, Dinosaurs), custom categories after
- Back navigation button returns to home page
- Uses calm-cards colour theme (#D4937A) for page styling (back button, hover border)
- Responsive padding: px-6 py-8 mobile, sm:px-8 sm:py-10 larger screens
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCategories.razor (new), src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCategories.razor.cs (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PhonicsPhases.razor is the closest pattern match for a category listing page
  - Back button colour should match the section theme colour (calm-cards #D4937A for Learning Cards, calm-phonics #7BA3C4 for Phonics)
  - Category tiles use flex-direction: column (emoji stacked above name) for visual prominence
  - Grid responsive breakpoints: 2 cols at mobile, 3 at 768px (md), 4 at 1024px (lg)
  - Code-behind follows pattern: file-scoped namespace, public partial class, [Inject] private properties with = default!
  - _Imports.razor already includes NowThenNext.Models so no additional using needed in razor file
  - E2E tests pass: 74/74
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors
---

## 2026-02-07 - US-058
- Created LearningCardGrid.razor page at route /learning/{CategoryId} with code-behind LearningCardGrid.razor.cs
- Page displays all cards for a category in a responsive grid (2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- Each card shows SVG/image only by default; tapping reveals the word below with a 0.4s fade animation
- Toggle behaviour: tapping a revealed card hides the word; revealing a new card auto-hides the previous one
- SVG built-in cards rendered inline via MarkupString; custom cards rendered as base64 img tags
- Category emoji and name displayed in page heading
- Back navigation to /learning
- Cards are square tiles (aspect-ratio: 1) with min-height 120px, rounded corners, subtle shadow
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCardGrid.razor (new), src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCardGrid.razor.cs (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used OnParametersSetAsync instead of OnInitializedAsync because the route has a parameter (CategoryId) that could change while the component stays mounted (Blazor same-route navigation)
  - RevealedCardId reset to null at start of OnParametersSetAsync to avoid stale state when navigating between categories
  - SVG detection: check if ImageData.StartsWith("<svg") to decide between inline rendering and base64 img tag
  - Card word reveal uses CSS opacity + max-height transition for smooth animation (max-height: 0 to 4rem)
  - Used :deep(svg) CSS selector to style SVGs rendered inside the card-image div
  - Single RevealedCardId state variable handles the "only one card revealed at a time" requirement
  - E2E tests pass: 74/74
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-059
- Added "Add Category" button tile (dashed border, + icon) to the category listing page (/learning)
- Added modal form with category name input (required, max 30 chars), curated emoji picker (30 child-friendly emojis), and live preview
- Modal uses existing pattern: boolean visibility flag, @onclick:stopPropagation on content div, backdrop click to dismiss
- Friendly validation message shown when trying to save without a name
- Default emoji (clipboard) assigned if none selected
- Category persisted via LearningCardsDataService.AddCustomCategoryAsync, page refreshes category list after save
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCategories.razor (modified), src/NowThenNext/Pages/LearningCategories.razor.cs (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Emoji characters in C# code-behind use Unicode escape sequences (e.g. "\U0001F697" for car emoji) - more reliable than pasting literal emoji in source
  - The emoji picker is a simple CSS grid of button elements, not a native OS picker - keeps it consistent and accessible
  - Dashed border style (border: 2px dashed #D4937A) visually distinguishes the "add" tile from content tiles
  - Modal max-height: 90vh with overflow-y: auto prevents content from overflowing on small screens when the emoji grid is tall
  - SelectEmoji method uses toggle logic (deselect if same emoji tapped again) for better UX
  - form-input uses box-sizing: border-box to prevent width overflow inside the modal
  - E2E tests pass: 74/74
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors
