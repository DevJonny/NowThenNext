# Ralph Progress Log - Learning Cards

Branch: ralph/learning-cards
Started: 2026-02-07

## Codebase Patterns
- Existing code-behind pattern: file-scoped namespace, `public partial class`, `[Inject] private` properties with `= default!`
- Pages use namespace `NowThenNext.Pages`, Components use `NowThenNext.Components`
- Check `_Imports.razor` before adding usings to code-behind — many are already global
- Run E2E tests after every story: `dotnet test tests/NowThenNext.Tests.E2E`
- WASM build is broken in local environment (ComputeWasmBuildAssets MSB4216 error) - pre-existing issue, not caused by code changes
- Use `dotnet build` to verify C# compilation (check for 0 C# errors even if WASM toolchain fails)
- Heredoc commit messages fail due to sandbox tmp restrictions - use inline `-m` flag instead
- Tailwind config is inline in wwwroot/index.html
- Follow PhonicsDataService pattern for static built-in data
- Dev server runs on localhost:5161

## 2026-02-07 - US-049
- Created LearningCategory and LearningCard models in Models/LearningCardModels.cs
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/Models/LearningCardModels.cs (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Models follow same pattern as ImageItem: file-scoped namespace, auto-initialized properties with defaults
  - PhonicsModels.cs puts multiple related models in one file, so LearningCardModels.cs follows the same convention (both LearningCategory and LearningCard in one file)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors

## 2026-02-07 - US-050
- Added calm-cards colour tokens to Tailwind config in wwwroot/index.html
- Colours: calm-cards (#D4937A), calm-cards-dark (#B87A62), calm-cards-light (#E0B0A0)
- Files changed: src/NowThenNext/wwwroot/index.html (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind colour tokens are nested under the 'calm' object, so they're used as `bg-calm-cards`, `text-calm-cards`, etc.
  - Follow the pattern of existing colour groups (phonics, activity) - add comment, then three entries (base, dark, light)
  - Build passes clean with 0 warnings, 0 errors
